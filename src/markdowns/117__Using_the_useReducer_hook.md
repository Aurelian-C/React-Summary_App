# Using the `useReducer()` hook

`useReducer()`, just like `useState()`, always ==returns an array with exactly two values==. Therefore, you can use array destructuring as we did it with `useState()` to pull out these values and store them in separate variables.

Now, the two values you are getting are the ==latest **state** snapshot==, because it is a state management mechanism like `useState()`, but you also get ==a **function** that allows you to update that state snapshot==. So that's kind of the same as for `useState()`, though the _state updating function (`dispatchFn`)_ will work differently. Instead of just setting a new state value like you do with `useState()`, with `useReducer()` state updating function (`dispatchFn`) you will ==dispatch an action==, and that action will be consumed by the first argument you pass to `useReducer()`, a so-called reducer function (`reducerFn`).

So `reducerFn` is a function that takes two parameters (`prevState` & `action`). `prevState` parameter gets the latest state snapshot automatically, because ==`reducerFn` will be called by React==, and `action` parameter gets the action that was dispatched, because ==React will call `reducerFn` whenever a new action is dispatched==. So then it gets the last state snapshot managed by React and that gets the action that was dispatched, that triggered the reducer function execution.

==Now `reducerFn` then also should do one important thing, it should **return a new updated state**==. So `reducerFn` is a bit like the state updating function of the `useState()` hook, but an extended version of that, you could say, because of that action thing.

> **IMPORTANT!** Don't forget to return a new updated state. The reducer function (`reducerFn`) should do one important thing, it should return a new updated state.

In addition, you can also set some **initial state** and also an **initial function** that should run to set the initial state in case your initial state is a bit more complex, for example, the result of let's say HTTP requests or anything like that.

## The reducer function `reducerFn`

You ==add/write your `reducerFn` function outside of the Component function==, because this `reducerFn` won't need anything from the Component, it won't need any surrounding data to find in the Component.

==The `reducerFn` shouldn't be write inside in your Component because whenever the state changes and the Component is re-evaluated, the `reducerFn` will be recreated on every Component re-evaluation==, so why we write our `reducerFn` outside of the Component function.

> **Note**: Only the `reducerFn` is write outside of your Component function, not the `useReducer()` hook. The `useReducer()` is always used inside of your Component function.

The `reducerFn` can be created outside of the scope of a Component function because it doesn't need to interact with anything defined inside of the Component function. All the data which will be required and used inside of `reducerFn` will be passed into the `reducerFn` when it's executed by React, automatically. So that's why we can define the `reducerFn` outside of the Component function.

> **IMPORTANT!** Don't forget to return a new updated state. The reducer function (`reducerFn`) should do one important thing, it should return a new updated state.

## The dispatch action `dispatchFn`

It's totally up to you what this **dispatch action** is. It can be a ==string==, it could be a ==number==, but often will be an ==**object** which has some _field that holds some identifier_== (often the field is then named 'type'), and then we also can add an extra payload to the action.

Identifier allows you to _identify the dispatch action inside of your reducer function_, so that in the reducer function you can run different pieces of code depending on which _action type_ was dispatched.

Below is an example with an action for `dispatchFn`. The `dispatchFn` has an action that is an object with a 'type' field that describes what happened, and extra payload with 'val' field that hold the value the user entered:

```react
dispatchFn({
    type: 'USER_INPUT', // is a convention to be all caps
    value: e.target.value
})
```

> **Note**: String that you pass as a value for the 'type' key it doesn't have to be all caps. That's just a convention you see a lot. The string need to be a clearly understandable identifier.
