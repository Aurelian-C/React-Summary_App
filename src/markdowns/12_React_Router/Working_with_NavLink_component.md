# Working with `<NavLink>` component

Sometimes you might want to see which link is currently active when you're on a page. To support links that should show us whether they active or not, `react-router-dom` has an alternative to the [`<Link>`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link) component, and that is the `<NavLink/>` component.

## Add classes or inline-styles to a link _conditionally_

==A `<NavLink>` is a special kind of `<Link>` that knows whether or not it is "active"==. This is useful when building a navigation menu such as a breadcrumb or a set of tabs where you'd like to show which of them is currently selected.

==By default, an `active` class is added to a `<NavLink>` component when it is active==.

==With `<NavLink>` you can **add classes or inline-styles _conditionally_**, based on whether a link is active or not==. With `<NavLink>` you can pass a function to either `style` or `className` that will allow you to customize the inline styling or the class string based on the component's active state. You can also pass a function as children to customize the content of the `<NavLink>` component based on their active state, specially useful to change styles on internal elements.

## The `isActive` property

`<NavLink>` is used just like `<Link>`, you can use it as a replacement for `<Link>`, but ==`<NavLink>` has one special behavior. If you add the `className` prop to it, it's actually not the regular `className` prop which takes a string (`className=""`), but instead it's a prop that takes a function, and that function should return the CSS class name that should be added to the `<a>` tag. Now that function also receives automatically an object from which we can destructure the `isActive` property==. This object with the `isActive` property is provided by `react-router-dom`, and `isActive` has a boolean value, `true` if the link is currently active (if it led to the currently active route) or `false` (if it did not lead to the currently active route). So therefore ==you can use `isActive` to conditionally return CSS class name or inline-styles==.

## The `end` prop

==By default, the behavior of `<NavLink` is to treated a link as active when its **descendant paths are matched**==. You can use the `end` prop to ensure that a component isn't matched as "active" when its descendant paths are matched. `end` pros take as a value a boolean: `end={true}` or `end={false}`. You can also just add `end` with no value and this means that `end` is automatically set to `true`.

If the `end` prop is used, it will ensure that the parent component isn't matched as "active" when its descendant paths are matched.
