# Layouts & nested routes

You can nest routes in other route with the help of <code>children</code> property.

The `<Outlet>` component specifies ==where the content of the child routes should be rendered==.

==An `<Outlet>` should be used in parent route elements to render their child route elements. This allows nested UI to show up when child routes are rendered==. If the parent route matched exactly, it will render a child index route or nothing if there is no index route.
