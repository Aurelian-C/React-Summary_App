# Data fetching with a "loader" function

==Each route can define a "loader" function to **_provide data_ to the route element _before it renders_**==.

When you define a "loader" function, React Router will automatically take any value you return in that "loader" function and will make that data available in the page that's being rendered, as well as any other components where you need it.

With the help of a "loader" function you move all the fetch logic that you have in a component in that "loader" function, and this process make the component way leaner and easier to reason about.

## Use the returned data from a "loader" function with the help of `useLoaderData` hook

To get access to the data returned by a "loader" function for a specific page, we can import `useLoaderData` from `react-router-dom`. 

> **Note**: ==`useLoaderData` always get the final data returned by the "loader" function==, even if "loader" function is an async function. If the "loader" function is an async function, the `useLoaderData` won't return a Promise from the "loader" function, but will return the resolved/rejected value of that async "loader" function.

The `useLoaderData` is a hook which we can execute to get access to the closest "loader" data. So ==you can access "loader" function data with the help of `useLoaderData` in _any component on the same level or lower level than the component where you added the "loader" function_==, so the route on which you added the "loader" function.

> **Note**: ==**You can use `useLoaderData` in the element that's assigned to a route _and_ in all components that might be used inside that element**==. You just have to be careful that you're not allowed to use `useLoaderData` on a higher level than you're fetching the data.

## Where should "loader" function code be stored?

Is common pattern that you actually put the "loader" function code into your component file where you need it, so to the page component file where you want to add the "loader" function to be precise.

## When are "loader" functions executed?

The "loader" function for a page will be called right when we start navigating to that page, so _not after the page component has been rendered_, but before we actually go there.

Data fetching is initiated as soon as we initiate the route transition (URL changes). By default, React Router will wait for the data to be fetched, so for the "loader" function to be finished, and ==only when the "loader" function is finished the page component will be rendered with that fetched data==.
