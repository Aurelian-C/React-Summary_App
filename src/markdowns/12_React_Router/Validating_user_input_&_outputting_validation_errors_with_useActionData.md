# Validating user input & outputting validation errors with `useActionData` hook

==`useActionData` hook does the same thing that `useLoaderData` hook==.

The `useActionData` hook provides the returned value from the previous navigation's `action` result, or `undefined` if there was no submission.

==The most common use-case for this hook is **form validation errors**==. If the form isn't right, you can return the errors and let the user try again:

![useActionData](../../img/useActionData.jpg)

==Like in "loader" function, the response that you return from your "action" function will be automatically parsed by the `useActionData` for you==.
