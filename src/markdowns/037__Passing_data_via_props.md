# Passing Data via `props`

==`props` are the **"attributes"** of your custom HTML elements (components)==.

==React will ensure that we get **one parameter in every component** which we use as a component, and that one parameter will be an **object** which holds all the received **attributes as properties**==, hence the name `props` for the overall concept. Therefore, we get one parameter, and you can name that parameter whatever you want. Typically, _it's named `props` to make it clear that is the object which holds all the values we get for the attributes on our custom element_.

==`props` is a super important concept because it allows you to **make your components reusable**, and it allows you to **pass _data_ from a component to another component**==.

_`props` are not limited to **dynamically** set values. We can do that, but we don't have to. We also **hard coded** value in `props`_. ==The main idea behind `props` is always the same though: we wanna make sure that **we can pass data into our components** to make them **configurable** and **reusable**==.

==`props` are our way of **passing data** from component A to B, and it's also totally fine to have a **component which just passes data on**. We pass data from a component to a direct child component, so to a component which is used in that other components JSX code, and we can't skip such a component==.

```react
const Component = (props) => {
    return <div>
    	<h1>Hello!</h1>
        <span>{props.introduction}</span>
    </div>
}

const App = () => {
    return <div>
    	<Component introduction='My name is Tom and I like football!' />
    </div>
}
```

> **Note**: The convention for props _which hold functions_ is to start with **"on"**:
>
> ```react
> <Cart onHideModal={hideModalHandler} />
> <Header onShowModal={showModalHandler} />
> ```
