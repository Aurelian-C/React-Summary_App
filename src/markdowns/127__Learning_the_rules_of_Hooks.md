# Learning the "Rules of Hooks"

**React Hooks** are simply all those **functions** that start with the word 'use' (`useState`, `useContext`, `useEffect` etc).

There are **two main rules** you have to know when it comes to working with React Hooks:

1. Only call React Hooks in **React Functions**! That means in a _React Component Function_, or also allowed in a _Custom Hook Function_.
2. Only call React Hooks at the **Top Level** of your _React Component Function_ or _Custom Hook Function_.
