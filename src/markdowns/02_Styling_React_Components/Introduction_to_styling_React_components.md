# Introduction to styling React components

You wanna make sure that your apps look good, and styling is also an important part of building components. And there are ==different techniques for setting styles== dynamically and for styling components, such that other components are not affected by a specific component's styles.

We will dive into how you can ==set up styles in a **conditional** _or_ **dynamic** way==, so how you, for example, can switch certain styles based on some conditions. For example, if a user enters an invalid input and you want to color the input field red.

Then we'll dive into ==two popular approaches for **scoping styles** to components==, so for setting up styles such that they only affect the component and are not added as global styles.

We'll have a look at ==**styled components**==, which is a third-party library, a very popular one, which allows us to set up pre-styled components with their own scoped styles.

We'll have a look at a concept called ==**CSS modules**==.
