# Listening to events & working with event handlers
You can respond to events in React by declaring *event handler* functions inside your custom components:

```react
function MyButton() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

> **Note**: Notice how `onClick={handleClick}` has no parentheses at the end! Do not *call* the event handler function: you only need to *pass it down*. React will call your event handler when the user clicks the button.

==On **all built-in HTML elements**, like `div`, `h2`, `buttons` and so on, we have **full access to all the native DOM events**, which we can listen to==.

==For all these default events, there is a `prop` equivalent in React==, which we can add to these built-in HTML elements to listen to these events. So instead of adding a listener as we would normally do it, for example `document.querySelector('button').addEventListener()`, which would be the imperative way of doing that, in React we add an event listener by going to the JSX element and there we add a special `prop`. But now it's not a `prop` which sets some value, but instead it's a `prop` which starts with `on`, because ==React exposes all the default events as `props` which start with `on`== (example: onClick, onScroll):

```react
const functionHandler = function() {
    // code here
};

<div onClick={functionHandler}></div>
<form onSubmit={functionHandler}></form>
```

==All these `on` props, all these event handler props (onClick, onSubmit, etc), want **a function passed as a value**, which then is _executed when that event occurs_==.
